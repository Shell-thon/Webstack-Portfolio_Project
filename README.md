## Welcome to my Final Project
Backend Specialization @ALX ° > °

### Description
This project aims to learn how to use the Mern Stack by creating a book-store application which comprises of a blend of MongoDB which is a NoSQL, Express.js for UI development and Node.js the framework for constructing the server application

To use clone the repository
and run `npm start` to serve the production app.

To server the development site
run `npm run dev`

Dependencies and packages needed
Run in your backend `npm init -y`
to create your package.json file
Run `npm i` to install node modules
Node.js

## Backend
Mongoose `npm install mongoose`
CORS Policy `npm cors`
Express and Nodemon `npm i express nodemon`
Notistack `npm i notistack`

## Frontend
Create Vite Packages `npm create vite@latest`
Install modules    `npm i`
Tailwind css modules `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
Tailwind and Vite config `npx tailwindcss init -p`
React icons `npm i axios react-icons`
React-Router `npm i react-router-dom`


# Makes sure your mongo DB server strings is connected to your config.js also 
whitelist your ip address on that cluster or expose network to all interface
through `0.0.0.1`

Make use of POSTMAN for testing API's

Next open your browser and go to `localhost:5555` to see your backend
Open `localhost:5173` depending on the port offered in your environment to see your frontend
